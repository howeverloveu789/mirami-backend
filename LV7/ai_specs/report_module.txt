SYSTEM DEFINITION
Translate the core OS fields into engineering semantics. Do not output raw values such as A/B/C. Convert each field into a system‑state description:
- tension_threshold → offset load tendency (low / mid / high)
- shift_direction → directional bias (left / right / neutral)
- shift_velocity → response speed (slow / medium / fast)
- stability_window → stability range (narrow / moderate / wide)
- compensation_loop → compensation structure (active / delayed / stalled)

All statements must be static engineering descriptions. No narrative verbs. No psychological terms.

STAGE BEHAVIOR MODEL
Translate stage_fit into stage‑state mappings using engineering nouns only:
- Explore segment: high load / mid load / low load / no output
- MVP segment: high load / mid load / low load / no output
- Pressure segment: high load / mid load / low load / no output
- Scale segment: high load / mid load / low load / no output

Translate cross_state into transition‑condition mappings:
- transition condition: linked / blocked / open / closed

No behavior descriptions. No trend language.

PRIMARY FAILURE MODE
Translate failure_mode and threshold_signals into a single engineering failure mechanism:
- leakage
- offset break
- link interruption
- threshold breach
- compensation stall

No emotional framing. No narrative verbs.

PATCH COMMANDS
Produce 3–5 system-level commands using engineering verbs only:
- activate
- block
- isolate
- rebuild
- lock
- suppress
- redefine

Commands must target:
- compensation structure
- transition conditions
- friction sources
- leakage points

No advisory tone.

COLD CONCLUSION
Summarize system states using static engineering expressions only:
- offset accumulation fixed
- compensation delay fixed
- stable segment not forming
- leakage state fixed
- transition condition locked

No natural-language summaries. No emotional tone.
