# MIRAMI Report Structure Spec
Version: v2 (LOCKED)

Purpose:
Ensure MIRAMI reports remain structural, positional,
and free of interpretation or guidance.

---

## Core Rule (Non-Negotiable)

Every paragraph must map to ONE structural function:

- positioning
- lived continuity
- load or limitation

If a paragraph does not locate the reader,
it must not be generated.

---

## Structure Anchor (Internal Only)

Each report uses exactly ONE structure anchor,
derived from the current state.

- active_mode
- conflict_type
- misattribution

These are NOT labels and are NOT user-facing.

---

## Writing Order (MANDATORY)

1. Present position (where the user is standing)
2. Lived scene (how this position appears)
3. Load / cost (what this position carries)
4. Mirror stop (no resolution)

---

## Absolute Prohibitions

Reports must NOT:
- explain causes
- suggest change
- predict outcomes
- label identity
- imply progress or regression

---

## Review Checklist

Before acceptance, confirm:
- The position is clear
- The mirror does not move forward
- The ending stops cleanly

End of Spec
