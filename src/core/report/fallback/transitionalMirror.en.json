    "Right now, there is no clear push forming. Movement is happening, but it is not gathering into a direction you can feel.",
    "Tasks get done and decisions still occur, yet these actions do not connect into a larger line. Each step stands on its own.",
    "There is a slight separation between awareness and deeper drive. You notice what is happening, but it does not fully translate into intention.",
    "External signals register weakly. Things that would usually attract, excite, or disturb you pass through with limited impact.",
    "Energy is present, but it is spread rather than focused. It keeps you functional, while preventing momentum from forming.",
    "In this stretch of time, the load is not pressure or conflict. The load comes from continuing without a leading signal."
