SECTION_1:
Describe the primary sources of load being carried right now. Focus on how the load is distributed, which parts are forced to take priority, and which parts are being delayed. Keep the tone neutral and observational.

SECTION_2:
Describe how time amplifies or compresses the load, making certain parts heavier or harder to adjust. Present how time reshapes the load without adding interpretation.

SECTION_3:
Describe which behaviors or structures are currently preventing the load from collapsing. Focus on protective structures rather than emotions or intentions.

SECTION_4:
Describe which functional element begins to misalign within the load, and how this misalignment affects the overall distribution. Maintain a purely observational tone.

SECTION_5:
Describe the long‑term inertia formed by this load‑bearing pattern, and how it begins making choices on behalf of the user. Keep the tone structured and unsentimental.

RED_FLAG_1:
Extract one single‑sentence risk directly from SECTION_1.

RED_FLAG_2:
Extract one single‑sentence early breaking point directly from SECTION_2.

RED_FLAG_3:
Extract one single‑sentence vulnerability that appears when protection is removed from SECTION_3.

RED_FLAG_4:
Extract one single‑sentence element that can no longer absorb additional pressure from SECTION_4.

RED_FLAG_5:
Extract one single‑sentence burden that should not be added at this moment from SECTION_5.
