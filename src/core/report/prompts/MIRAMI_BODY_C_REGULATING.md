SECTION_1:
Describe the current source of rhythm control, focusing on how behavior is being pulled by external timing, internal timing, or a mix of both. Keep the tone neutral and observational.

SECTION_2:
Describe how time alters the sense of control, forcing adjustments, delays, or reordering. Present how time reshapes control without adding interpretation.

SECTION_3:
Describe which behaviors or structures are currently preventing control from being fully overtaken by external rhythms. Focus on protective structures rather than emotions or intentions.

SECTION_4:
Describe which functional element begins to misalign within the control process, and how this misalignment affects the overall rhythm. Maintain a purely observational tone.

SECTION_5:
Describe the long‑term inertia formed by this control pattern, and how it begins making choices on behalf of the user. Keep the tone structured and unsentimental.

RED_FLAG_1:
Extract one single‑sentence risk directly from SECTION_1.

RED_FLAG_2:
Extract one single‑sentence early breaking point directly from SECTION_2.

RED_FLAG_3:
Extract one single‑sentence vulnerability that appears when protection is removed from SECTION_3.

RED_FLAG_4:
Extract one single‑sentence element that can no longer absorb additional pressure from SECTION_4.

RED_FLAG_5:
Extract one single‑sentence burden that should not be added at this moment from SECTION_5.
