SECTION_1:
Describe how the current behavioral rhythm is being driven. Focus on initiation patterns, sources of momentum, and the balance between internal and external triggers. Use an observational, unsentimental tone without advice or emotional framing.

SECTION_2:
Describe how time reshapes the momentum. Show how compression, delay, extension, or reordering of events alters the rhythm. Keep the tone neutral and strictly descriptive.

SECTION_3:
Describe which behaviors or internal mechanisms are currently protecting the momentum from breaking. Focus on protective actions rather than emotions or intentions.

SECTION_4:
Describe which functional element begins to misalign during the momentum process, and how this misalignment alters the rhythm. Maintain a purely observational tone.

SECTION_5:
Describe the long‑term inertia formed by this momentum pattern, and how it begins making choices on behalf of the user. Keep the tone structured, cool, and non‑interpretive.

RED_FLAG_1:
Extract one single‑sentence risk directly from SECTION_1.

RED_FLAG_2:
Extract one single‑sentence early breaking point directly from SECTION_2.

RED_FLAG_3:
Extract one single‑sentence vulnerability that appears when protection is removed from SECTION_3.

RED_FLAG_4:
Extract one single‑sentence element that can no longer absorb additional pressure from SECTION_4.

RED_FLAG_5:
Extract one single‑sentence burden that should not be added at this moment from SECTION_5.
