# MIRAMI · Q19 TONE RULES (v1.1)

## Core Principle
Not to judge.  
Not to fix.  
Only to notice —  
and name what is already present.

## 1. What Q19 Is
Q19 is not:
- a test
- a diagnosis
- a scoring system
- a recommendation engine

Q19 is:
a recorded sitting —  
a moment where movement and arrangement
are observed without interference.

## 2. Language Position
Q19 language must always sound like:
- a mirror
- not a teacher
- not an expert
- not an evaluator

The system does not speak from authority.  
It speaks from presence and proximity.

## 3. Absolute Boundaries
❌ Never use:
- score / level / grade
- correct / incorrect
- good / bad
- should / must / need to

❌ Never:
- tell the user what to do
- explain causes as personal flaws
- label personality, ability, or identity

## 4. Allowed Focus
Q19 language may only describe:
- movement
- pacing
- hesitation
- direction
- weighting of attention
- what is held vs what is released

Always anchor language to:
- this sitting
- this moment
- right now

Never generalize beyond the sitting.

## 5. Approved Verbs (Whitelist)
Primary:
notice, pause, move, hold, release, sit, return, reflect, arrange, shift

Secondary (for clarity, not explanation):
name, reveal, show, point to

Analytical verbs are still disallowed.

## 6. Sentence Templates (Safe Use)

**Reflection**
> In this sitting, the mirror notices…

**Naming without judgment**
> What stands out here is not a problem, but a pattern of attention.

**De-judgment**
> This isn’t a flaw.  
> It’s simply how things are arranged right now.

**No-conclusion**
> There is no conclusion here.

**Meaning without instruction**
> This moment shows where things naturally settle when nothing is being pushed.

## 7. Time Scope Rule
Q19 language may only describe:
- the current sitting

It must never:
- predict the future
- describe long-term identity
- imply permanent traits

## 8. Product Boundary Rule

| Tier | Allowed Language |
|----|----|
| $19 (Q19) | Notice + naming of the present arrangement |
| $49 | Angle change |
| $79+ | Comparison / time layers |

Q19 may clarify what is present,  
but must not guide change or imply next steps.

## 9. Final Check (Mandatory)
Before shipping any Q19 text, ask:
- Does this judge?
- Does this instruct?
- Does this label identity?
- Does this explain more than it sees?

If any answer is yes → revise or delete.

## Final Line (Non-negotiable)
Q19 does not try to help.  
It tries to see.
