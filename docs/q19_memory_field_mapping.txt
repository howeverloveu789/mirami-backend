Q19 MEMORY FIELD MAPPING (v1)
================================
$19 Standalone – Behavior Path Language
LOCKED – Append Only

This file maps API write fields
to the Q19 memory storage structure.

This mapping is FINAL for v1.
No retroactive edits are allowed.

--------------------------------
SOURCE OF TRUTH
--------------------------------
This mapping strictly follows:

docs/q19_memory_spec.md

If a field is not defined in the spec,
it MUST NOT be written at $19 stage.

--------------------------------
CORE GUARANTEES
--------------------------------
1. Store real human behavior language
2. Preserve raw user text as-is
3. No scoring, no interpretation
4. Append-only memory
5. One submission = one memory entry

API → MEMORY FIELD MAPPING
--------------------------------

API FIELD
---------
memory_version

WRITES TO
---------
memory_version

RULE
----
- Constant value
- Always set to: "q19.v1"


API FIELD
---------
created_at

WRITES TO
---------
created_at

RULE
----
- System-generated
- ISO-8601 timestamp
- Generated at write time only


API FIELD
---------
context.prompt_id

WRITES TO
---------
context.prompt_id

RULE
----
- Identifies which fixed question was answered
- Allowed values:
  "S1"  (Success 1)
  "F1"  (Failure / Stuck 1)
- Prompt wording must match spec exactly


API FIELD
---------
context.type

WRITES TO
---------
context.type

RULE
----
- User-declared state
- Allowed values only:
  "success"
  "stuck"
  "fail"
- System MUST NOT infer or override


API FIELD
---------
behavior_path.situation

WRITES TO
---------
behavior_path.situation

RULE
----
- User-described situation
- Stored only if explicitly provided
- No normalization or rewriting


API FIELD
---------
behavior_path.action_taken

WRITES TO
---------
behavior_path.action_taken

RULE
----
- What the user actually did
- Stored as raw language
- Optional but preserved if present


API FIELD
---------
behavior_path.action_not_taken

WRITES TO
---------
behavior_path.action_not_taken

API FIELD
---------
raw_text

WRITES TO
---------
raw_text

RULE

- Typos, emotion, repetition preserved
- No trimming, summarizing, correcting

--------------------------------
FORBIDDEN AT $19 STAGE
--------------------------------
The following actions are strictly forbidden:

- Scoring
- Traffic light assignment
- Behavior labeling
- Keyword extraction
- Summary generation
- Sentiment analysis
- Backfilling older entries

--------------------------------
FINAL STATEMENT
--------------------------------
Q19 ($19) memory exists to capture
REAL human behavior paths in raw language.

Meaning is deferred.
Interpretation belongs to higher tiers.

This file defines HOW data is written,
not how it is used.
