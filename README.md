# MIRAMI

MIRAMI reflects how a stretch of time is being lived,
even as the way people describe that time changes.

This repository implements MIRAMI.

Core behavior, boundaries, and invariants are defined in:
docs/MIRAMI_CORE_BOUNDARIES.md

If anything conflicts with that document,
that document wins.
